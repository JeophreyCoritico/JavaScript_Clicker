NOTE:
MPS: Meat Per Second
MPC: Meat Per Click
"Tabasco" upgrade does not really add 10% of MPS to MPC, instead adds 10% of the current MPS to the MPC 

EXAMPLE: 
If buying the upgrade when MPS is 10 the MPC updates to 2 (1 (Initial MPC) + 1 (10% of 10)), however when MPS updates to 20 the MPC is is still 2. 
The MPC should be 3 since 1 + 2 (10% of 20).

You would have to buy the upgrade when MPS is 20 to gain + 2, however in this case MPC would now be 4

Could not figure it out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
